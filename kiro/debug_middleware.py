"""
Debug logging middleware for Kiro Gateway.

This middleware initializes debug logging BEFORE Pydantic validation,
which allows capturing validation errors (422) in debug logs.

The middleware:
1. Intercepts requests to API endpoints (/v1/chat/completions, /v1/messages)
2. Calls prepare_new_request() to initialize buffers and loguru sink
3. Reads and logs the raw request body
4. Passes the request to the next handler

Flush/discard operations are handled by:
- Route handlers (for successful requests and Kiro API errors)
- Exception handlers (for validation errors and other exceptions)
